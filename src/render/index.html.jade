    h1 Sanelotto â€” deployment tool for any languages
    p Sanelotto is developed for fast and easy application deployment on the server.
    p Sanelotto is suitable for any frameworks and languages. The setup is quite easy - you need to simply edit the JSON configuration files and enter any comands on any desired language.
    p After creating the project you will get two directories, one for the local machine (usually a virtual machine on Continuous Integration service) and one for the server. The local part connects to the server through SHH after updating the repository on GitHub. After that, the local part updates the project on the server.
