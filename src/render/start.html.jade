    h2 How it works?
    p Sanelotto use two machine - local and server. Usually, local machine is a Continuous Integration virtual machine
        | or developer's personal computer. Server is a main platform for project- VPS, dedicated server or other. Local
        | machine gets signal from CI about updating repository on GitHub and deploy update application to server through
        | SSH connect. Step-by-step:
    ol
        li As a result of an update Sanelotto run on local machine -
            span.code=' sanelotto start local'
        li
            b='If specified in the configuration. '
            | Local machine run predefined (before-type) commands.
        li Local machine connect to server through SSH-key or login/pass authentication.
        li Local machine start server part through
            span.code=' sanelotto start server '
            | and disconnect.
        ol
            li
                b='If project not exist on server. '
                | Server download project from GitHub.
            li
                b='If project exist on server. '
                ol
                    li Server update project from GitHub.
                    li
                        b='If specified in the configuration. '
                        | Server run stop-type commands.
        li
            b='If specified in the configuration. '
            | Server replaces predefined files in project to other (
            a(href="/overwriting.html").inline_a overwriting
            | ).
        li Server starts the project (start-type commands).
    h2 Project on local and server
    p After creating new project through
        span.code=' sanelotto generate '
        | or
        span.code=' sanelotto create [NAME] '
        | you will have directory with project name and two directories inside:
        span.code=' Sanelotto_local '
        | and
        span.code=' Sanelotto_server'
        | .
